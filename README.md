# lvgl_for_Lilygo_T-Display-S3

The lvgl samples in this repository are specifically designed for beginners and hobbyists using the Lilygo T-Display-S3.

Currently, these samples can be used with the Arduino IDE, but I may explore using Visual Studio Code in the future. The version of lvgl used is lvgl 8.3.7.

To use these samples, you need to add a lv_conf.h file next to the lvgl folder in the Arduino library folder. The attached lv_conf.h file is the one used by the available samples. Keep an eye on this file as it may need updating when adding new samples.

Samples specifically designed for the touch version of the display will be stored under 'lvgl_for_Lilygo T-Display-S3 cap'.

Please note that the current samples are relatively simple and in an early stage. The documentation and lvgl samples provided at https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/intro/index.html are often outdated and may require modifications. It could be due to my current understanding of the library.

I should also mention that the relatively small screen size limits the library's usage to some extent, especially for the touch version. Nevertheless, interesting applications can still be created.

Any suggestions or tips related to this topic are highly appreciated!
